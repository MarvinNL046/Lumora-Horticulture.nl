#### 4.2 Calculating Growing Media Scope 3 Emissions

**Rockwool Example** (per 1,000 plugs):
- Production: 7.8 kg CO2eq
- Transport: 0.9 kg CO2eq
- Disposal: 0.7 kg CO2eq
- **Total: 9.4 kg CO2eq per 1,000 plugs**

**Plastic Trays Example**:
- Production: 9.5 kg CO2eq
- Transport: 1.2 kg CO2eq
- Disposal: 1.4 kg CO2eq
- **Total: 12.1 kg CO2eq per 1,000 plugs**

**Paper Plugs**:
- Production: 1.9 kg CO2eq
- Transport: 0.6 kg CO2eq
- Disposal: 0.3 kg CO2eq (carbon sequestration in compost)
- **Total: 2.8 kg CO2eq per 1,000 plugs**

**Annual Reduction Example** (500,000 plugs/year):
- Switch from rockwool: **3,300 kg CO2eq saved**
